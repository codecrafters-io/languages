This is a starting point for {{language_name}} solutions to the
["Build Your Own React" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/redis).

In this challenge, you’ll build a barebones React implementation that supports
function components and hooks. Along the way, you’ll learn about React’s API,
DOM-diffing algorithm, hooks and more!

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to
[codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) to try the challenge.

# Passing the first stage

The entry point for your React implementation is in `{{ user_editable_file }}`.

Study and uncomment the relevant code, and push your changes to pass the first stage:

``` sh
git add .
git commit -m "pass 1st stage" # any msg
git push origin master
```

That's all!

# Stage 2 & beyond

TODO: Add notes on testing locally.
