This is a starting point for C solutions to the
["Build Your Own Docker" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/docker).

In this challenge, you'll build a program that can pull an image from
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and execute commands in it. Along the way,
we'll learn about [chroot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot),
[kernel namespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_namespaces), the
[docker registry API](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/) and much more.

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to
[codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io) to signup for early access.

# Usage

1. Ensure you have `gcc` installed locally
1. Download
   [`docker-explorer`](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/docker-explorer), as
   [mentioned here](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/docker-explorer).
1. Follow the details below ("Running your program locally") to run your Docker
   implementation, which is implemented in `app/main.c`.
1. Commit your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution
   to CodeCrafters. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.

# Running your program locally

Since you'll need to use linux-specific syscalls in this challenge, we'll run
your code _inside_ a docker container.

```sh
docker build -t my_docker .
docker run --cap-add="SYS_ADMIN" my_docker run some_image /usr/local/bin/docker-explorer echo hey
```

(remember to re-run `docker build` each time you make changes to your code!)

# Passing the first stage

CodeCrafters runs tests when you do a `git push`. Make an empty commit and push
your solution to see the first stage fail.

```sh
git commit --allow-empty -m "Running tests"
git push origin master
```

Go to `app/main.c` and uncomment the implementation. Commit and push your
changes, and you'll now see the first stage pass.

Time to move on to the next stage!
