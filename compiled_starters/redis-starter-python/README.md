This is a starting point for Python solutions to the
["Build Your Own Redis" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/redis).

In this challenge, you'll build a toy Redis clone that's capable of handling
basic commands like `PING`, `SET` and `GET`. Along the way we'll learn about
event loops, the Redis protocol and more.

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to

# Usage

1. Ensure you have `python (3.8)` installed locally
1. Run `./spawn_redis_server.sh` to run your Redis server, which is implemented
   in `app/main.py`.
1. Commit your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution
   to CodeCrafters. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.

# Passing the first stage

CodeCrafters runs tests when you do a `git push`. Make an empty commit and push
your solution to see the first stage fail.

```sh
git commit --allow-empty -m "Running tests"
git push origin master
```

You should see a failure message that says it wasn't able to connect to port
`6379`.

Go to `app/main.py` and uncomment the server implementation. Commit and push
your changes, and you'll now see the first stage pass.

Time to move on to the next stage!

# Troubleshooting

## module `socket` has no attribute `create_server`

When running your server locally, you might see an error like this:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/.../python3.7/runpy.py", line 193, in _run_module_as_main
    "__main__", mod_spec)
  File "/.../python3.7/runpy.py", line 85, in _run_code
    exec(code, run_globals)
  File "/app/app/main.py", line 11, in <module>
    main()
  File "/app/app/main.py", line 6, in main
    s = socket.create_server(("localhost", 6379), reuse_port=True)
AttributeError: module 'socket' has no attribute 'create_server'
```

This is because `socket.create_server` was introduced in Python 3.8, and you
might be running an older version.

You can fix this by installing Python 3.8 locally and using that.

If you'd like to use a different version of Python, change the `language_pack`
value in `codecrafters.yml`.
