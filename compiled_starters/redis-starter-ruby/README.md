This is a starting point for Ruby solutions to the
["Build Your Own Redis" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/redis).

In this challenge, you'll build a toy Redis clone that's capable of handling
basic commands like `PING`, `SET` and `GET`. Along the way we'll learn about
event loops, the Redis protocol and more.

# Usage

1. Ensure you have `ruby (2.7)` installed locally
1. Run `./spawn_redis_server.sh` to run your Redis server, which is implemented in
   `app/server.rb`.
1. Commit your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution
   to CodeCrafters. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.

# Passing the first stage

CodeCrafters runs tests when you do a `git push`. Make an empty commit and push
your solution to see the first stage fail.

``` sh
git commit --allow-empty -m "Running tests"
git push origin master
```

You should see a failure message that says it wasn't able to connect to port
`6379`.

Go to `app/server.rb` and uncomment the server implementation. Commit and
push your changes, and you'll now see the first stage pass.

Time to move on to the next stage!
